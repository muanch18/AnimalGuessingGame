# AnimalGuessingGame

## Description

Created Spring 2021. This game is a version of “20 Questions” where the only category is animals. You think of an
animal and your program will try to guess the animal by asking you a series of “yes or no”
questions. The program uses a tree to represent its knowledge about animals. Each leaf node contains the
name of an animal and each interior node contains a question. If your guess is not correct, the
program will augment the tree with the animal you were thinking of by asking you what your
animal was and asking for a question to distinguish your animal from your previous guess. It employs allocating space, using registers, loops, and referencing functions from C in Assembly.
